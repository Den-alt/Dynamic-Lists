# Dynamic-Lists
Working with dynamic lists in C/C++

_Task:_

In the list, organized as a stack, enter a sequence of character strings that contain five-digit codes of unsigned integers. Remove any erroneous strings from the list based on a function that checks whether the specified character string is a correct entry for the five-digit number code and returns the decimal numeric value of that number (or zero if the code is incorrect). Then print a table of the remaining five codes and their decimal values. A feature will be the placement of decimal values in a separate dynamic array.
